# Swaption-Pricing-via-Hull-white

"This repository comprises a case study on certificate pricing and an exercise on swaption pricing, both within the context of financial engineering. The case study and exercise are designed to enhance understanding and practical application of financial modeling techniques. Here's an overview:

**Case Study: Certificate Pricing**
   - Scenario: Bank XX considers issuing a structured certificate described in Annex 1 on January 31, 2023, at 10:45 C.E.T.
   - Questions to Address:
     a. Calculate the upfront percentage (X%) that the bank should receive under mid-market conditions.
     b. Explore alternative model selections and determine the upfront in these cases.
     c. Evaluate the error associated with using the Black model, taking into account implied volatility for the strike of interest.
     d. Assess the feasibility of using different models if the structured bond has a three-year expiry with specific conditions.
     e. (Optional) Value X% under certain hypothetical conditions.

**Exercise: Swaption Pricing via Hull-White**
   - On January 31, 2023, price 3y7y and 5y5y ATM swaptions (with the strike equal to the corresponding Forward rate) using Euro market data versus Euribor 3m.
   - Implement a 1-factor Hull-White model with specific parameters.
   - Perform pricing using both the Jamshidian formula and a tree-based approach.
   - Compare the results obtained from these two pricing methods.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for individuals interested in certificate pricing, financial modeling, and swaption pricing within a single curve framework, offering practical exercises and insights into the application of financial engineering concepts."
